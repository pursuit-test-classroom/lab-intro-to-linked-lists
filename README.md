# Linked List Practice

### Getting started

1. Fork and clone this repository.

1. Navigate to the cloned repository's directory on your command line. Then, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

This will install the libraries needed to run the tests.

1. Open up the repository in VSCode. Follow the instructions below to complete the Lab.

### Tests

To run the tests, you can run the following command from the command line. You will need to be in the root directory of your local directory.

```
npm test
```

This will run the test output once.

Two arrays to work with:

```js
const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 0];

const panagram = [
  "The",
  "quick",
  "brown",
  "fox",
  "jumps",
  "over",
  "the",
  "lazy",
  "dog",
];
```

You will

- Create a Node class with properties
  - data
  - next
- Create a linked list with properties
  - head
- Linked List Methods
  - `insert`
  - `size`
  - `delete` by key
  - `getFirst` element
  - `getLast` element
  - `search` an element by key and return data
  - `getKth` retrieve kth element
  - `getKthToLast` retrieve kth from last element
  - `isEmpty` check if list is empty
  - `clear` the linked list
  - `toArray`convert data from linked list to an array
  - `containsDuplicates` check for duplicates - return true if contains duplicates, false if not

## Bonus

Build a doubly-linked list with all the same methods

## Super Bonus

JavaScript `class` syntax is syntactic sugar - that means it is a newer easier to read/write syntax that does the same thing as an older syntax.
